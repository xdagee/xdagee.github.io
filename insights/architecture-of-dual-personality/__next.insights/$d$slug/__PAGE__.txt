3:T5ec,<p>When I set out to build my portfolio, I faced a common dilemma for senior engineers: <strong>Who am I optimizing for?</strong></p>
<p>Recruiters want measurable outcomes, ROI, and leadership signals. They want the "Executive" view.<br>
Fellow engineers want to see code, architecture decisions, and "the metal". They want the "Technical" view.</p>
<h2>The Solution: Mode Switching</h2>
<p>Instead of compromising, I decided to build both. Using <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS variables</strong>, I created a global state machine managed by <code>zustand</code> that toggles the entire application's personality.</p>
<h3>The Code</h3>
<p>It starts with a simple hook:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">// src/store/personality.ts
export const usePersonalityStore = create&#x3C;PersonalityState>()(
    persist(
        (set, get) => ({
            mode: 'EXECUTIVE',
            toggleMode: () => {
                const newMode = get().mode === 'EXECUTIVE' ? 'TECHNICAL' : 'EXECUTIVE';
                set({ mode: newMode });
            },
        }),
        // ... middleware
    )
);
</code></pre>
<p>This single pivot point drives everything: typestyles, color tokens, and even the content itself.</p>
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This isn't just a gimmick. it's a demonstration of <strong>empathy for the user</strong>. By asking "who are you?", I can serve the <em>exact</em> information you need, without noise. That is the essence of good product engineering.</p>
